TODO for clj-yahoo

YQL:
-Add YQL filtering functions, like sort.
-Add INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE YQL operations. These will require HTTP
  operations POST, PUT, and DELETE, respectively, which may require another
  fundamental change to the code structure. Also, I'm not sure if I can
  abstract away the HTTP request details.
-Add tests for core functions. Will probably want to create a separate Yahoo
  API key (token and secret) for this.

Query:
-Add a query type (instead of using a straight map) and import that into 
  core
